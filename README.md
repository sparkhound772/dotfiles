The Neovim config files now has their ![own repo](https://github.com/sparkhound772/nvim.git).

A simpler and plugin-free version remains here for when that's desired, along with various other configs.

__.zshrc__ mosly contains some aliases to be appended to the Oh My Zsh config file, possibly along with:
_zsh-autosuggestions_
_zsh-syntax-highlighting_
_zsh-history-substring-search_

__.vimrc__ possibly need some updating, but should contain the basics needed.

__alacritty.toml__ is sourcing it's themes from [alacritty/alacritty-theme](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty-theme)
